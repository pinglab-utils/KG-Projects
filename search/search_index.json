A knowledge graph is a hybrid of a traditional relational database and a graph. It consists of a set of concepts and the relationships among them. In biomedicine, knowledge graphs can be a powerful tool for organizing and interpreting complex biological systems, diseases, and their relationships with genes, proteins, and drugs, enabling more informed decision-making and the development of new treatments and therapies. For example, knowledge graphs can be leveraged for personalized medicine by representing attributes of a patient (e.g., patient's medical history, genetic information, and other relevant data) to tailor treatment plans to the individual patient. In biomedical research, knowledge graphs \u2013 consisting of the relationships among biomolecules, functions, and system phenotypes \u2013 enable investigators to gain a better understanding of how these systems work and how they may be disrupted in disease states. Knowledge graphs are constructed with a specific purpose, for example, to predict interactions among proteins, biological processes associated with biomolecules, or manifestation of pathology that may be treated by drugs. All relevant data must be curated before performing analyses, analyses such as path-walking methods or machine learning approaches (e.g., link prediction with graph neural networks). These Knowledge Graphs were developed as part of the class projects from UCLA Bioinformatics 201 Winter 2023 and as hands-on projects from Bridge2AI ENABLE Scholar Program. Each knowledge graph must include: - Title - Description - Use Cases - Workflow - Schema A Sample KG Project Following is a sample knowledge graph class project prepared by instructors. We encourage students to follow the similar pattern and add more information. Title: A comprehensive knowledge graph of cardiovascular drugs, diseases, proteins, and pathways Description: Knowledge Graphs can link diverse sets of data and facts, reveal new relationships, and suggest mechanisms for further study. In this project, various data sets (cardiovascular drugs, diseases, proteins, and pathways) are extracted from biomedical databases and systematically integrated into the Knowledge Graph (KG). In the first place, integrated KG assists in the advanced search and implementation of graph algorithms for underpinning hidden relationships. Next, KG becomes the underlying infrastructure for developing advanced graph-based machine learning (e.g., Graph Neural Network (GNN), Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)) for link prediction between entities. Use cases: Use Cases: 1. Novel drug target prediction: Using the knowledge graph to explore the relationship between a cardiovascular disease (CVD) and drugs linked to protein drug targets, which may share multiple biological pathways with many proteins, to help identify potential novel drug targets. Drug repurposing: Find potential new uses of existing drugs by linking drugs with other disease phenotypes that are not currently designated for the drug by examining the complex subgraph of a graph network. Workflow: An example of a workflow for Use Case 1 Novel drug target prediction. First, a disease of interest is determined. Associated drugs and disease identifiers are curated from DrugBank and ICD11, respectively. The relationship between these drugs and diseases are extracted from UniProt and other prospective databases. Finally, UniProt identifiers are extracted from UniProt to determine pathways in which these proteins play a functional role from Reactome. These data in total are used to construct a knowledge graph. Schema: An example of a Knowledge Graph Schema for Use Case 1 Novel drug target prediction. A schema of the knowledge graph, consisting of all four node types and their relationships are depicted. Biomedical resources are detailed adjacent to the node.

Drug repositioning has gained interest in recent translational research. However, the repurposing of a drug may contain adverse physiological effects. Therefore, testing the efficacy and downstream consequences of drug repurposing is necessary but also demands great experimental financial costs. We designed a knowledge graph by leveraging various public databases, including DisGeNET, Drug-Gene Interaction Database, and Harmonizome, to screen the broad transcriptional and ontological repercussions of drug repositioning to facilitate search of new therapies. Databases Drug repositioning has gained interest in recent translational research. However, the repurposing of a drug may contain adverse physiological effects. Therefore, testing the efficacy and downstream consequences of drug repurposing is necessary but also demands great experimental financial costs. We designed a knowledge graph by leveraging various public databases, including DisGeNET, Drug-Gene Interaction Database, and Harmonizome, to screen the broad transcriptional and ontological repercussions of drug repositioning to facilitate search of new therapies. Knowledge Graph: Our knowledge graph combines relationships from DisGeNET, DGIdb, and Harmonizome to visualize the downstream transcriptional effects of drug repositioning for our disease of interest, in this case diabetes. Our schema describes the associations between each node entity. Our graph contains 29907 total nodes and 299968 edges. There is 1 Disease node, 7105 Drug nodes, 21777 gene nodes, and 177 transcription factor (TF) nodes. Each node contains attributes Name, Type, and Color to distinguish them as unique entities. There are five different types of edge relationships. Connections between Disease and Transcription Factor (TF), of which our graph contains 23 edges, explain that a TF \u201cassociates with\u201d a disease. Similarly, Disease-gene connections communicate that a gene \u201cassociates with\u201d a disease, and we observe 807 such relationships in our graph. Furthermore, 437 edges connect Drug to TF, which means that a drug \u201ctargets\u201d a TF. Edges where a drug \u201ctargets\u201d a gene are seen 12876 times in our graph as Drug-Gene node connections. Lastly, the majority of edges in our graph, 285820 to be precise, are between TF and Gene, which suggests that a TF \u201cregulates\u201d a gene. Each edge contains 2 attributes. The weight of the edge is determined by the weight or score given by the corresponding database, gene-disease association for Disease-TF/Gene, Drug-Gene Interaction score for Drug-TF/Gene, and positive or negative regulation for TF-Gene. The association type of the edge is the description of the relationship that we previously defined. Use Cases Drug Prioritization: Identify drugs with high specificity for targeting a disease-associated gene. With our knowledge graph we identify drugs with high gene specificity based on the drug gene interaction score from DGIdb to minimize the off-target binding that may lead to poor drug efficacy. This will help researchers prioritize drugs with high specificity when repurposing a drug for another disease. The figure below shows a subset of our knowledge graph, as well as interaction scores with a known diabetes drug metformin with its target genes. We listed interaction scores above 0.1, and this value can be tuned for the user\u2019s needs. Drug Repercussions: Identify affected pathways downstream of a drug target. Another use of our knowledge graph is to explore pathways of genes downstream of a drug target. This can help researchers identify novel and adverse effects and risks of drug repositioning, thus facilitating their assessment of drug candidacy. We took downstream genes of metformin target SP1 that overlap with diabetes-associated genes and conducted pathway enrichment using EnrichR and KEGG pathway database. As expected, we identified insulin-related pathways but we also observed metabolic and lipid-metabolic pathways, as depicted in the table below. We see some consequences of metformin on biological pathways other than the desired insulin-related pathways. These findings are also consistent with recent research. Studies have shown that these novel lipid-metabolic effects suggest that metformin can be repurposed for weight loss. While the use of metformin for weight loss is considered off-label and not approved by the FDA, some studies have suggested that it may be effective in promoting weight loss in certain populations, particularly those with obesity and insulin resistance. Our knowledge graph\u2019s ability to capture these effects demonstrates its utility for drug repositioning research.
